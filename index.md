# Welcome!

This site details supplmentary information related to spaceborne chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) in low-earth orbit (LEO).

## Site Map
[**Keyword Survey**](https://spaceborne-pcms.github.io/keywordsurvey): This page details the findings from a survey of keywords from the Institute of Electrical and Electroncis Engineers (IEEE) and Optica (formerly known as The Optical Society).

[**Qualification of Spaceborne PCMs**](https://spaceborne-pcms.github.io/qualification): This pages contains tables detailing information on the organizations that have worked on material qualification in LEO. Academic research laboraties, companies, and space agencies are detailed for having studied materials in both simulated LEO conditions or in situ.

[**Evaluation in Simulated Environments**](https://spaceborne-pcms.github.io/simulatedevaluation): This page details the locations (on a world map) of organizations that have studied materials in simulated LEO environments.

[**In Situ Evaluation**](https://spaceborne-pcms.github.io/insitu): This page provides a graphical timeline of the missions to study materials for LEO in situ.
